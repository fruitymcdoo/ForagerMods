Everyone Poops

Everyone Poops is a Forager mod designed to adjust the availability and accessibility of one very important resource: POOP!

In Forager, you can only get Poop when you feed a Cow. This leads to overfeeding and it has one big problem, as we all know, everyone poops!

This mod will add Pooping functionality to all creatures including the Player!

Features:
- Creatures poop randomly without eating
- Enemies poop on death
- Player poops randomly as well as when taking massive damage

This mod is still in development and is in an incomplete state.
